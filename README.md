# Memory-Allocation-Project-using-Segmentation-

Segmentation is a memory-management scheme that supports user view of a program. A program is a collection of segments. 

## Project objectives: 
Implementation of Allocation and deallocation techniques using segmentation. 

## Inputs: 
1. User inputs total memory size 
2. User inputs holes starting address and size. 
3. User inputs Processes one by one. 
4. User inputs for each process:               
a. Number of segments.             
b. Name and size of each segment.
5. User inputs the method of allocation (first fit or best fit). 

## Scenario to be done:
1. Allocate segments using either First-Fit or Best-Fit allocation methodology.
2. If one segment or more of a process can not fit in any hole you should generate a message to state that this process does not fit.
3. Deallocate a process (The user chooses a process to deallocate, you should deallocate all segments of this process and consider their spaces as holes to be used later and add them to any neighbouring holes). 
 
## Output:
Your output is a drawing representing memory layout after each allocation or deallocation. Also, you should show the contents of the segment table for each process.
